You’ve never been very comfortable with guns or monsters, so you choose the door with the beaker. 
You enter the room and .nd yourself in a very traditional laboratory. Large white counters . ll the room. All available surfaces are cluttered with papers, computers, test tubes, beakers and cages with various rodents. 
All the computers are down so you race about, picking up and reading various notes that are out in the open to .nd out what people were working on in this room. What you read is some pretty high level genetic research, most beyond what you can understand, but you can gather that people were working on developing chemical cocktails that dramatically alter human body chemistry if consumed. 
You turn around and look at the far wall. There are two glass cases. Each one .lled with dozens of small glass vials. In one case, the vials are .lled with a red liquid, in the other the vials glisten with blue. 
You walk over to the case and read the labels on the bottle. You understand that these are the .nished products of what the papers were talking about. There is writing on the vials that you don’t understand. 
You came here looking for a weapon and it looks like you found it. You just don’t know what it does.
