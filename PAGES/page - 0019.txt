is a series of explosions at the gun torrents. Black smoke fills
your vision.
An explosion next to you sends you flying through the
air. You hit the ground hard, but thankfully not hurt in any
real way. You get to your knees and look around.
The doors are lost in smoke and fire but you can still hear
many people yelling and gunfire through the haze. There are
soldiers running past you into the smoke in the direction of
the hangar doors. To your left the giant slug blocks your path
to the docks. You look over your shoulder and see a group
of soldiers blindly fleeing into the jungle. The saucer hovers
overhead, firing at the building and those trying to escape; it
is only a matter of time before it targets you.

building, turn to page 130.
