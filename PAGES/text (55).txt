The coin comes up tails so you go right. You slosh over to the door. Mr. McWhiskers .ies behind you, careful not to get his paws wet. 
The door has a big red button next to it on the wall. You push the button and the door slides open, like something out of Star Trek. Maybe that poster does make sense. 
You step into blackness. You move forward with your hands outstretched. Mr. McWhiskers hisses behind you. 
The door slides shut, cutting off what little light there was. You stumble forward and hit a spongy wall. You back away from it into another wall. You reach out and . nd that there are now walls on every side of you. 
Suddenly, bright lights illuminate the room. 
There does not appear to be any kind of wall around you. You are standing in the center of the open room, but when you try to move in any direction you hit an invisible blockade. Mr. McWhiskers mews angrily next to you. He is contained in a similar trap. 
There are spaceman with ray guns point at you two. The aliens are making a strange, rhythmic, screeching noise. 
They take both of you to an intergalactic zoo and place you in an exhibit with another man. He has become unhinged at being taken captive by aliens that he rants and raves all day and night about being “unstuck in time,” whatever that means. 
Eventually, Mr. McWhiskers becomes so annoyed with the fellow that the cat slits his throat and rolls around in the man’s blood. 
THE END
