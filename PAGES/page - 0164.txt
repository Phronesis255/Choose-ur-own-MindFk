You hold up your hands, signaling to the alien captain
that you do not wish to fight at this moment. It would be great
to get one of these things talking. Find out what’s going on.
The captain’s hand moves quickly. Before you have time
to react, he whips out his ray gun and fires.
Suddenly a gray blur darts in the way of the beam. It’s
Mr. McWhiskers!
His furry body crumples to the floor and thrashes about.
He screeches and howls and your heart breaks.
“What the fuck did you do to my cat?”
The alien is looking at Mr. McWhiskers with a cocked
head, confused.
The cat is now sitting up looking unharmed but-
different. He now wears a black leather collar with silver
studs around his neck. Both his ears now have multiple
piercings and each paw has a chain link bracelet. The oddest
addition to Mr. McWhiskers’ new wardrobe is the black
leather jacket. Chains hang down all along it and on the back
is a full color painting of a depressed-looking man sitting at
a table, drink in hand. Gaudy green letters proclaim, “Too
Drunk To Fuck.”
Mr. McWhiskers looks up at you and says in a tiny little
kitty voice, “Oi.”
You scream at the alien, “What the fuck did you do to
my cat!”
The alien raises the gun at you. Screaming, you charge.
With one hand you knock the weapon away and with the
other you deliver a vicious upper cut. Your fist hits the soft
spot of flesh under the chin and breaks right through the skin.
Your hand comes out in his mouth, tearing and breaking his
jaw and tongue.
He flaps on your hand like a hooked fish but the bastard
isn’t dead.
You hit him with your other hand. Your new super-
strength snaps and reshapes bones. Soon there is nothing
more than a twitching red mess caught on your hand.
