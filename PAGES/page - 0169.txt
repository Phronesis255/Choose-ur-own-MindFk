may be changed but at least you get to stay alive.
Farnsworth smiles at your choice, “Excellent, I was
hoping you would choose that. I am very curious to
experience the effects of the device myself.”
He spins around and starts tapping at the keyboard.
In the center of the room, a hole suddenly reveals itself
and a platform emitting a strange purple glow rises up.
Farnsworth walks past you and up on the platform, “Well
come on.”
You cautiously step up onto it.
Farnsworth turns to you and smiles, “Let’s rock and roll.”
Suddenly your vision goes completely purple and you
lose all sense of your body.
You find yourself standing in a pure white space that
seems to go on forever in every direction. No hint of anything
in any horizon. No speck on the ground to ruin its purity. Just
white everywhere.
Put down this book and go dig out an old board game. Grab
a six-sided die from it and then come back.
Roll the die to see where you go.
