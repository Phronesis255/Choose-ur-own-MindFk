32
You rush forward and swing the vertebrae club with all
your might. His head explodes green blood and bone. The
view screen is splattered with the gore.
That was anti-climatic.
You look about the now-empty bridge thinking about
what to do next. You see the empty captain’s chair and can’t
resist sitting in it.
You sit down and lean back, placing your hands on
the armrests. Suddenly, silver cords spring out of the chair
around your arms, legs, waist, and neck, locking you into
place. You are trapped.
You hear a mechanical whirring and feel a stabbing pain
at the back of your head as the chair drills metal rods into
your brain.
Then the pain is replaced with euphoria. You obtain an
awareness of the saucer. It has become part of your body and
you part of it. You can sense every function of the ship from
life support to power.
You can even sense Mr. McWhiskers moving about
inside as his killing spree takes him into the deepest bowels
of the ship, hunting down any living thing aboard.
You can also access all the of the ship’s data including
the coordinates of the invaders originated home planet. You
mentally plot the course and the saucer shoots straight out of
the Earth’s atmosphere at an amazing speed.
You smile as Mr. McWhiskers slaughters the last crew
member. Soon you will arrive at the coordinates, the alien
home world, and the two of you will bring the fight to them.
