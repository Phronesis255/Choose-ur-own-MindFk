is a series of explosions at the gun torrents. Black smoke .lls your vision. 
An explosion next to you sends you .ying through the air. You hit the ground hard, but thankfully not hurt in any real way. You get to your knees and look around. 
The doors are lost in smoke and .re but you can still hear many people yelling and gun.re through the haze. There are soldiers running past you into the smoke in the direction of the hangar doors. To your left the giant slug blocks your path to the docks. You look over your shoulder and see a group of soldiers blindly .eeing into the jungle. The saucer hovers overhead, .ring at the building and those trying to escape; it is only a matter of time before it targets you. 
Join the soldiers running through the smoke to get into the 
building, turn to page 130. 
Join the soldiers .eeing into the jungle, turn to page 38. 
Try to climb over the giant slug, turn to page 144.
