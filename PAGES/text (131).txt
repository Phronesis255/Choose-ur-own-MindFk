140 
Your hair gives way to a smooth shaved head. You are now wearing blue jeans, a plain white t-shirt, and black suspenders. Your muscle mass has tripled and your IQ has halved. You want to go to a bar and get shitfaced, maybe even listen to some Symarip or Murphy’s Law. 
You’re walking down the street when a gang of punks decked out in chains and Mohawks runs up to you. They brandish broken bottles and knives and call you “Nazi.” 
You try to explain to them that you are a SHARP (SkinHead Against Racial Prejudice) but they are too drunk to take in what you are saying. You have more than a hundred pounds on the largest one of them but they all attack you at once, slicing and kicking as you fall to the ground. 
One stands next your head and keeps kicking. 
As the world goes black you sing in a weak voice to yourself, “Rudie can’t fail.” 
Bullshit, you fail and you fail bad. 
THE END
