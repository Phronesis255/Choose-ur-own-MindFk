You back away from Solok, ready to attack if you have

The spaceman’s ray gun has transformed Solok. He now

The smoke clears, revealing the biggest thing you
have ever seen. In many ways it looks like a kind of giant
crocodile. It’s on all fours and covered with green scales that
glisten in the daylight. Instead of lizard-like legs, the thing’s
legs are thick with knotty muscle. The front pair bends out
