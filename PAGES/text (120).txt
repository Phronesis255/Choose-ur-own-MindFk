blood loss and grab the computer. You don’t have much time before your body gives out. 
You tear open the tower and pull out wires. You make a couple quick alterations to the ends of them and jab them straight into your exposed brain. 
You convulse as your consciousness enters the computer system and your body dies. You have a moment of disorientation as you stretch your digital limbs. You open and shut doors all over the building and turn and look about with new security camera eyes. 
You search and search but there is no one left alive in the building. You look out of computer screens and call out over intercoms. There is no one left. 
You try to reach out through phones lines, to contact others but they are all down. The computer system, the building, stands on its own. All satellite communication has been cut off. You are stuck in the building, alone. 
On a screen in a lab you pull up Solitaire and begin to play, hoping that the rest of the world is doing OK. If humanity wins, there is hope that satellite contact will reopen. Then you can ride the digital waves and leave this building. 
You hope and wait for a rescue that never comes. 
THE END
