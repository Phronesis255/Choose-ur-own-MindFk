You can see in the distance a giant rampaging thing that
looks like a cross between a gorilla and a turtle. It stands
on all fours and has a large puke-green shell. The massive
brown limbs end in gargantuan hands that it smashes through
buildings. Its gigantic body squishes flat all those who can’t
get out of its way fast enough.
The thing sees you flying toward it and raises its fists
high in the air, letting out a high pitch screeching roar.
You and Mr. McWhiskers fly around to opposite sides,
flanking the beast. You hover in the air and prepare to make
your attack.
Before you have time to act, Mr. McWhiskers bursts
through the creature’s right eye, disappearing into its head.
The monster remains standing but starts violently convulsing.
Thick black blood begins to pour of its mouth, nose, and ears.
Its left eye explodes as Mr. McWhiskers exits the
monster’s head.
The monster sways from side to side, gore and viscera
flowing heavily from its ruined sockets. It crumbles to the
ground,dead.
You look over at Mr. McWhiskers to praise him and
call him a good kitty, but the words freeze in your mouth
when you see the malicious glare in his eyes. You can tell his
bloodlust has not been sated.
Ten inch claws shoot out of his paws as he charges you.
You raise your arms in defense to protect your head but
Mr. McWhiskers quickly severs them at the elbows. Blood
sprays from your stumps into the air and rains on to the
ground below. Before you even have the chance to scream
he decapitates and disembowels you. As your disembodied
head falls to the ground, you see Mr. McWhiskers begins
gorging on your corpse.
You should have known better than to trust a cat. They’re
heartless bastards.
