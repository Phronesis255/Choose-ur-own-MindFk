“Go down that hall. All survivors are to head to the dock
for immediate removal.”
You nod and head down the hall the soldier gestured to.
You walk for what seems like several minutes down
winding halls. Occasionally you come to a split but there is
always a soldier stationed to direct your way. A few times
soldiers rush past you and head deeper into the building, and
you hear gunshots coming from somewhere in the distance
far too often.
Finally, you come to the dock. The hall leads outside to
the large shipping yard. People, soldiers and scientists alike,
are rushing about loading supplies and themselves on the
numerous ships. You look down the waterway and see some
boats receding into the distance.
A soldier with a clipboard stands off to the side,
overseeing the operation. You go up to him.
“I’m here to be evacuated, what should I do?” you ask.
The soldier doesn’t even look up from his board. He
says, “Just get on any ship that is still boarding. We are to
rendezvous at a set of prearranged locations later to assess
the situation.”
You nod, even though he’s not looking at you, and go
toward the ships. The two closest to you are large battleships.
The third is a small coast guard-like boat.
