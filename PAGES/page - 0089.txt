window. The monster is here!
One problem at a time.
You race toward Nelson, ready to pound his head in,
when two giant claws the size of compact cars burst through
the walls. The claws sway about for a moment and then
quickly snap forward.
You dive as one just misses your head.
The other workers keep typing.
The claw furthest from you catches a worker - you think
his name is Stephen but you could be wrong. It begins to
drag him away from his computer but he holds onto his desk
with surprising strength and keeps updating the database.
Finally the claw tears him from his workstation. He
begins to thrash and scream, trying to pull himself free.
You stare in horror as the claw pulls Stephen - yeah,
you’re sure it’s Stephen - toward the thing’s terrible mouth.
The monster’s head reminds you of a massive centipede.
Its mouth has two large claws protruding from the side,
flexing and eager for food. Thick green slime drips down its
chin.
Stephen screams and struggles as the monster brings him
to its mouth. The claws on the side dart forward and pull in
the man. The screaming abruptly stops and is replaced with
crunching bones and clicking keyboards.
The monster swallows with a loud gulp and the claws
come tearing back into the office.
