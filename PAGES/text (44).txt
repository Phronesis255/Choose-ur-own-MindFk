Nurse, please apply piercings.” 
The woman grabs your mouth and purses your lips. She drives a pen through your lips and leaves it. Binding your mouth and spraying your face with a red mist. She pushes another through and another. When she is done there are .ve pens through your lips. It hurts too bad to even try screaming. 
The man goes back to work. He digs his . ngers into the cuts and grips the . aps of .esh just above your ears. He pulls back hard, tearing your scalp away from your head. He continues until the skin is only attached to your head by a strip down the center. 
“Stapler,” he says. 
The woman hands him a plain of.ce stapler. He uses it to attach both the opposite sides of your scalp together. 
He stands back and smiles, admiring your wonderful new Mohawk. 
THE END
