He turns around and takes off his glasses. He absent­mindedly cleans them with his shirt and says, “I’m afraid neither work out that well for us.” 
“The .rst option is what I call the ‘Super-Maker.’ By releasing several thousand tons of gene-rewriting gas into the air, every normal human on Earth will gain super-powers. What the powers are exactly will vary from person to person, but it should give the human race a . ghting chance. 
“When the gases are released into the atmosphere they will turn the sky a lovely shade of purple the whole world over. The problem is that we will not be here to see that. The propulsion unit uses so much energy that it will overload Complex 23’s power station and destroy everything on the island, including us. 
“The second option is a device that I recently acquired from a Dr. Taylor in London. It is a device that transports its users through time and space. We can travel back to before this disaster. The problem is that we will retain no memory of what has happened and we are not guaranteed to even be ourselves at the other end. We could end up as anyone from anytime. I was hoping to work out the kinks of the machine before it was ever used but I don’t think I’ll get my chance to do that. 
“I’m so happy you showed up. You can decide which plan I should go with. I’ve been putting off making a decision as I’m just a scientist. I invent and study these things. It’s not my job to take responsibility for their use. So, what should we do?”
