You do not need to go back and finish the fight. You have
escaped from that corporate hell and with this new power
there is so much more that you can do. The big picture has
suddenly gotten a lot bigger.
You fly over to your apartment to save Mr. Me Whiskers
because if you do not, who will?
Rather than entering the front door to the building, you
smash through the window.
Your apartment is in total disarray. Mr. McWhiskers flies
in circles around you, mewing with joy, his long gray fur
matted tightly against his small body. Whatever has changed
you has also changed your cat.
He flies up to you and rubs his face against yours, purring.
You hold him tight, the two of you happy to reunite in the
wake of all this strangeness.
The building rocks as a monster moves somewhere close
by. You can’t stay here. This place is not safe. You cradle Mr.
McWhiskers under your arm and fly out the window.
As you soar through the sky, Mr. McWhiskers wiggles
his way out of your grip and takes flight next to you.
With this new power there is now a whole new world
open to Mr. McWhiskers and you.

Go after the flying saucers that are responsible for all this
horror, turn to page 107.
