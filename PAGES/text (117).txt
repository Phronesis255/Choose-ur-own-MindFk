You slam against the door and it does not budge. 
You throw yourself against it again, putting all your strength into it, and the door .ies open. You fall through and tumble to the ground. 
All the windows of the shop have been boarded up. The only light is coming from several movie-shoot-style lamps. In the center of the room is a large tarp. On the tarp is a woman who looks like she’s spent many years on the street doing more than one type of blow. She’s giving oral sex to a pig. 
Looking at their faces, you can’t tell which of them is enjoying this less. 
There is a man on one side of the room with a digital video camera. He moves around the scene, capturing the grotesque display. Flanking him are two very large men in black suits. They hold pistols. 
All three turn to you in shock. The woman stops, swine cock still in mouth, and stares. Even the pig stares. 
The two armed men rush forward. One shuts and boards up the door. The other puts the barrel of his gun to your head. 
“What the fuck you doin’ in here?” he asks. 
You try to talk but only weak whines come out. 
The building shakes as the monster walks outside. 
“Damn storm,” says the man at the door. 
They don’t know what’s going on. 
You start to cry and try to talk but the man with the gun slams the butt of his weapon into your temple. 
You fall and somewhere distant you hear pig squeals.
