You pick the door with the gun on it. That seems like
the obvious best choice. You open the door and step into a
room lined with racks of guns and explosives that go from
the floor to the ceiling. There are handguns, machine guns,
rifles, grenades, C-4, and a shit ton of other things that can
blow things up.
You walk to the far wall in a daze, thrilled at your score.
You grab a giant gun off the rack that is almost as big as you.
You can barely hold the massive weapon.
The door slams open behind you.
You spin around and there are two people standing in the
doorway, each clad all in black. They have huge Mohawks.
One has a handgun. The other is holding out human intestines
wrapped around his hands like piano wire.
You don’t even think. You pull the trigger, sending a
barrage of bullets at the punks. In a split second, you lose
control of the gun as its kickback knocks you to the ground.
Bullets spray and bounce around the room. In the entirety of
Complex 23 this is probably the worst place for you to lose
control of a high-powered machine gun.
One bullet nicks a package of C-4 and half of the Complex
is engulfed in an explosion. Fortunately, it happens so fast
that you feel no pain as your body is blown into thousands
of tiny bits.
