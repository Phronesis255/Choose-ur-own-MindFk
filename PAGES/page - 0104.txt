“So what’s your plan?”
Solok doesn’t answer at first. “Don’t grieve for me, this
is logical.”
You eye him suspiciously, “Solok, what are you going
to do?”
He stares without emotion at the monster. He finally
says, “The needs of the many...”
“...Outweigh the needs of the few,” you finish.
“Or the one,” he says, still looking at the monster. Solok
turns to you, “I always have been and always will be your
friend.”
He brings up his right hand, curled in a fist, and raises
his index and pinky fingers - flashing you devil horns. “Live
long and prosper.”
