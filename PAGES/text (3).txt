You have a moment of panic as you imagine the apartments above you burning. You rush to the front door and lace up your black boots. 
You open the door and step out into hell. 
The apartment buildings on the opposite side of the street are now a ten-story inferno. You can feel the heat of the .ames from where you stand. Black smoke rolls down the street so thick that you can taste it. Through the haze, you see vague silhouettes. 
You run down the street. You need to get away from this death trap. 
The air is .lled with screams and sirens. As you near the intersection, you feel, more than hear, a low pounding. 
The next street is not much better. Random buildings are burning and the people are running in pure panic. An overturned police car is in the center of the road, its lights still .ashing. 
There are times in life when the whole world is turned upside-down. Moments that one can never go back from. This is yours. It’s obvious that the world is ending around you.
