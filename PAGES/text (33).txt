You don’t want to .ght the helicopters, they are humans just like you are…used to be. But you don’t see any other choice. 
You wait until the helicopters are close but not close enough to attack you. You open your mouth and, just like before, a bright blue beam shoots out and tears into the helicopters. In an instant all the helicopters are nothing more than brightly burning wreckage hurtling to the ground. 
As you watch the burning metal plummet, something strange happens to you. You don’t feel bad for what you did. You like it. 
You turn to a nearby building and slam your body into it. The structure collapses to the ground sending up a cloud of dust from the rubble. 
You turn your head and see a crowd of humans running away. You open your mouth and your beam burns them all to a crisp. 
You raise your head high into the air and roar. You stomp down the street knocking over buildings and burning .eeing crowds of people. You .nally understand why monsters do this. 
This is going to be fun. 
THE END
