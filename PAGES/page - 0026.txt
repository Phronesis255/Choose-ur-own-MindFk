You pull out spikes from your head and charge at this
Trekkie firebug. He points his hands at you and great long
bursts of fire shoot out. But you’re too fast and you dodge
the attack, the flames narrowly missing. You feel the heat on
the back of your neck.
You leap at him, stabbing forward with your spikes. With
a loud CRACK both weapons snap in half when they make
contact with his chest. His uniform doesn’t even tear. You
both freeze for a moment, surprised.
He acts first, raising both of his hands he puts them right
in your face, giving your head a double-dose of full on fire.
Your vision is filled with dancing flames but it doesn’t even
hurt, just feels pleasantly warm.
The flames stop and you can see his cocked head
regarding you. “I do not believe it is logical for us to continue
this battle.”
You nod, agreeing.
“Solok.” He holds out his hand.
You take it and introduce yourself, “Si.”
He breaks the handshake and points past you. “I believe
he is someone it is logical to attack.”
You turn around and see a lone spaceman walking
towards you from across the street.
You grin and pull two fresh weapons from your head. “1
got ‘em.”
You charge and the spaceman raises the ray gun at you
and fires. You easily duck the black beam and jam both spikes
into his gut. They sink in up to your hands and thick green
goo oozes out from the wounds. The spaceman convulses.
You pull out the blades and the corpse collapses straight to
the ground.
“Piece of cake,” you say while turning around.
Solok is curled up on the ground where you left him. The
spaceman’s raygun must have hit him when you ducked.
You rush over to him and kneel down. “Solok, are you
OK?”
