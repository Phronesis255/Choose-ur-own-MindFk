67
Blood flows out and travels through the air into the
swirling void above you.
You begin feeling weak as the blood drains from your
body. It’s difficult, but you manage to get out the last words
of the spell before you fall dead.
In the sky, new stars blink to life and somewhere on
Earth, the beast wakes.
