You stand on the bridge of the Galganex, the mothership
of the invasion fleet. Before you is a wall of view screens.
Each screen displaying a new devastation every twenty
seconds. Your eyes dart around and you laugh to yourself. It
was so easy to turn the planet, and even humans themselves,
against humanity. All it took was a little genetic rewiring and
there was instant planet-wide panic, destruction, and death.
This is a truly glorious day for the empire. You will have
many decorations awaiting you when you return home.
Human life is already extinct on three of the planet’s
continents. You better get down there soon if you want to get
in on the fun.
You take the turbolift to the hangar bay. There, you put
on a spacesuit to protect yourself from the Earth’s dangerous
atmospheric pressure. You board one of the saucers and fly
down to the Earth.
Your ship flies high in the atmosphere but even from up
here you can see the glow of the fires on the ground, their
black pillars of smoke rising around you.
You ask the navigator to locate a high concentration
of human survivors and are quickly given coordinates.
In moments, the saucer is hovering above the surviving
infestation.
Fly around in your ship and rain death from above, turn to page 57.
Land and get your hands dirty, turn to page 162.
