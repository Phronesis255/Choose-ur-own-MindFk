You round a corner and see that the noise came from a
comic book store that has just burst into flames. The building,
filled with paper and cardboard products of all sorts, is a
raging inferno with flames pouring out from the front door
and windows.
Two people stagger out of the building, their bodies
completely engulfed.
Another person emerges from the building but appears
to be completely unharmed. Even his clothes appear to be
untouched by the scorching heat. He appears to be wearing
a Star Trek uniform. You were never a fan of the show, too
cheesy for your taste, but you recognize the costume. He’s
even wearing pointy ears to match the blue pajamas.
He lifts his hands above his head and points a hand at
each of the burning people. Thick pillars of flames burst
forth from his hands. The two people fall to the ground,
finally dead.
He turns his head and sees you. Hate flares up in his eyes.
Uh oh.
Try talking to him, turn to page 142.
Go on the offensive. Attack! Turn to page 26.
