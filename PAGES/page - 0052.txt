You’ve heard too many weird things about Farnsworth
to follow him into a secret passageway. He motions to you
to follow with his hand and you shake your head. You start
toward the Control Room.
“Have it your way,” Farnsworth says. He retreats in the
passageway and shuts the door. There is no sign he was ever
even there.
You move slow and silent to the Control Room door. You
press your ear to the door but hear nothing. You push it open
and walk in.
The room is pitch black. Even with the lights out, the
room should be bathed in the cool blue of computer screens.
The door slams shut behind you, cutting off the little bit
of light that was leaking in.
You spin around in the dark trying to get your bearings.
A pair of hands grabs your shoulders from behind and pulls
you back. You stumble and fall. Another set of hands grabs
your feet and hoists you into the air.
You are slammed down on a table and a bright light
flashes on directly above your face. It is blinding. You squint
and look around. There is a fat shirtless skinhead holding
your feet down and another holding down your arms. They
tie your limbs to the table legs.
Two people spring up on your left and right. One is
a woman with two bright blue spikes on each side of her
head, twisting up like horns. The other is a man with a green
Mohawk and a surgical mask covering his face. They are
both dressed all in black.
“He is unchanged,” says the man wearing the surgical
mask, “immediate surgery is required.”
He raises his hand and you see he is holding a scalpel.
The skinhead above you grabs your head.
The man starts slicing along your hair line on each side of
your head. The blade digs in hard and you can feel it scrape
bone. You scream as your blood soaks the table.
The man stops. “I can’t work under these conditions.
