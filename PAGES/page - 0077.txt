You started off your day at the office just like any other.
You had a stack of TPS Reports that had to be completed
by five and six databases that needed to be updated with
customer information on three hundred new clients.

You squint your eyes. You can see smoke and fire. A
black curtain rises up, blocking your view.
You look around to see if anyone else is noticing this but
everyone is working.
You turn back to the window and watch the fire and
