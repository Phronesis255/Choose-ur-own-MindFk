73
You sit up a little higher in your chair so you can look
over your computer. You glare at John Smithe.
You don’t like him.
You could tell from his first day, 1,019 work days ago,
that he was a worthless employee. He doesn’t take the work
seriously, it takes him too long to complete an assignment, and
you bet he doesn’t even know what the TPS Reports are for.
And now, you look down at the note he handed you a
moment ago. He is planning a mutiny against Supervisor
Nelson. Of all the nerve!
At 11:14, he drops his pen and goes back to the break
room. Amazingly, everyone in the office stands and follows.
You duck down in your cubical and wait for the traitors
to pass by. You get on all fours and peek around the wall.
You watch John hype the drones up with his blasphemous
message. The hoard raids the supply closet, adding theft to
their already sizable list of charges.
You crawl out of your cubical and make your way to the
Supervisor’s office. Outside his door, you sneak a quick look
back. The mob is still distracted.
You know you should knock, but the noise might alert
the others to your plan. So as quickly and quietly as possible,
you open the door, rush in, and shut it behind you. You turn
around but instead of Supervisor Nelson, you are greeted by
a Tyrannosaurus Rex with a head the size of a jumbo jet. The
outer wall of the office has been demolished and you stand
on a ledge fifty stories high. The beast eyes you as drool and
fragments of wood and concrete fall from its open mouth.
This is impossible. You know that dinosaurs aren’t real
and that God planted fossils six thousand years ago as a test
of faith.
The monster’s head darts forward with speed that seems
unnatural for a beast of such large size.
It takes a bite and proves you wrong.
