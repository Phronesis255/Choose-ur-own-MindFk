You decide to head deeper into the complex. Too many
people, including you, have dedicated too many years of their
lives to this project. Not to mention that if the experiments
have gotten loose, it will not matter if you escape. The whole
world will be doomed.
Holding out your staple gun, you creep down the
hallways. The control room is three floors up and on the
opposite side of the immense building. You don’t know how
you are going to get there alive but you have to risk it.
You creep your way up three flights of stairs poised and
ready to fight the whole time, each step echoing too loudly
for your comfort.
You make it to the third floor and go through the door.
One of the complex’s maintenance workers is crucified to
the wall with nails. Two additional nails stab through the
worker’s eyes.
You lean over and throw up. In between painful heaves
you hear a wet slithering sound. You force yourself upright
and hold out the staple gun, resisting the rolling waves of
nausea.
The shitty stapler does not seem so comforting anymore.
There are two directions ahead. If you go left, you will
come to the control room. There is your best chance at
regaining control of the facilities. If you go right, you will
come to the laboratories. There’s your best chance at getting
some better weapons to protect yourself.
Go left in the direction of the control room , turn to page 58.
Go right in the direction of the labs, turn to page 156.
