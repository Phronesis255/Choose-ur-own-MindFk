You open your eyes deep underwater. There is almost
no light but that does not impede your progress. Your limbs
push you smoothly through the water and you can feel a
large shell protecting your body.
You look around and see that you are in the middle of
a group of dozens of creatures, all just like you. They look
like turtles, except most turtles don’t have large tusks jutting
from their mouths.
The school of monsters is swimming lazily through the
water. You decide to rise to the surface to see where you are.
As you begin to go up, the rest of the beasts follow you.
You break the surface and look around. You are off the shore
of a big city. The flying saucers circling it and smoke rising
from a dozen different locations ensures that is where you
will find a fight.
You swim toward shore and all the other monsters
follow. You and your army hit land and you are surprised to
find that you are able to walk on just your back legs - turtles
shouldn’t be able to do that.
A group of flying saucers is parked nearby on the sand
and you rush toward them. You are about three times as big
as the saucers, so when your body slams into the closest one
it flips several times in the air before crashing and crumpling
like a tin can.
When the other monsters see you do this, they begin to
attack the other flying saucers.
Wow, you think, that was easy. It took you no time to
build a monster army.
You join the attack on the saucers. Now the spacemen
are beginning to organize and fight back. A beam from one
of their rayguns cuts right through your shell. You cry out as
green blood splatters on the sand.
All the other turtles stop their attack and turn to look
at you. You can see slobber dripping from their mouths
and hunger in their eyes. They all ignore the spacemen and
charge at you, mouths and teeth gnashing.
