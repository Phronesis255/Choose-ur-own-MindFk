You decide to take on the .ying saucers. They are the ones responsible for all this meaningless death and destruction and you’ve had enough. You’re going to bring the . ght to them. 
You and Mr. McWhiskers .y over the city looking for your target. Beneath you everything is burning and you can see roving gangs moving through the streets. It is pure chaos. 
You quickly come upon one of the saucers hovering in the air and shooting its death rays at the people and buildings below. You slam into the hull and break through. 
Mr. McWhiskers follows. 
You . nd yourself in a dark hallway. Most of the light is coming through the hole you created. The walls are made of some weird pink and spongy material that looks organic, like a skinned dog. There is half a foot of some unknown clear liquid covering the . oor. 
On the wall in front of you there is a poster for the J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie, crudely taped up. You approach the poster slowly. You are very confused. Why would aliens be Star Trek fans? 
Never mind that now. 
You look to your left and right. There are doors on either side of you. 
You take a coin out of your pocket. You can’t think of a better way to decide where to go. Heads, left. Tails, right. 
Find a coin and . ip it. Turn to page 87.
