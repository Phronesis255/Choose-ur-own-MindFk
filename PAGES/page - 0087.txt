The coin comes up heads so you go left. You slosh over
to the door. Mr. McWhiskers flies behind you. Hovering a
foot above the floor, careful not to get his paws wet.
The door has a big red button next to it on the wall. You
push the button and the door slides open, just like something
out of Star Trek. Maybe that poster does make sense.
You step through and find yourself in a large room of
computer banks and about a dozen aliens. They are all
wearing identical silver jumpsuits with their heads and hands
exposed. Their skin is cracked and bright red - like that of
burn victims.
The entire far wall is a giant view screen. Right now it
is displaying a building toppling over from the saucer’s ray
blasts. You see burning people falling like leaves from its
windows.
This must be the bridge of the ship. Facing the screen
one of the aliens sits in a large chair. It is the captain’s chair.
The captain stands up and points at you. His speech sounds
like gargling wasps.
The aliens charge you.
Mr. McWhiskers flies out from behind you and
immediately decapitates the nearest alien with his super-
sized claws.
You rush an alien and punch him in the stomach. Your
fist shoots straight through, splattering thick milky goo all
over you. As you pull your fist back, you grab hold of the
thing’s spine and pull it out.
The alien falls over and you spin around, swinging the
bone. You hit another invader, shattering its spine and head.
In moments, you and Mr. McWhiskers have utterly destroyed
all the aliens except for the captain.
The captain stands firm. He is not backing down from
you.
