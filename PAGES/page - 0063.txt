63
The poor fools.
Your tentacles dart down, snatching up members of the
crowd and shoving them into your mouth. Your teeth grind
them into a fine pulp, your meal’s screams and bone-cracking
are a sweet song to you. Your followers don’t agree. They
scurry away in terror.
You climb onto land and start smashing their monuments
to stupidity.
Above you, the sky turns from light blue to deep scarlet.
Every living thing across the planet hears a chorus of
unearthly cries and the world goes insane. In Japan, sushi
rolls force their way down diners’ throats, choking them to
death. In Mexico, prairie dogs attack towns en masse, using
the moment as their opportunity for revenge against their
cruel human oppressors. In Iran, a small boy is beaten to
death by a pack of living prosthetic limbs.
You were the first to awaken but you are not the last.
A new eon has come to Earth.
