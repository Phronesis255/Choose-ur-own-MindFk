The thing’s claws grab onto two other screaming workers
as you run toward the beast’s face. It is looking through one
of the holes that it is bashing into the side of the building.
You are at the edge and look around for something to
use as a weapon to fend off the monster - your supply closet
arms will not do. The thing is crunching on another white
collar snack. You only have moments before its attack will
resume.
You are still looking about frantically when a desk
comes flying through the air and slams into you, sending you
sliding toward the open air and a fifty story fall. Your head
spins and you look up to see Nelson running at you with a
filing cabinet raised above his head.
You get to your knees but he’s already on top of you,
slamming the cabinet down into your face. You fall back,
blood pouring from your mouth, nose, and ears, and your
arms flail out into open air.
Nelson stands above you and gives you a swift kick in
the balls, causing immense pain and humiliation. He pushes
you further over the edge.
Your head falls back and you see the monster eyes
twitching with hunger lust at you two. It has finished its
snack and is ready for more.
You try to warn Nelson of the immediate danger, but
another kick to your bruised and busted balls silences you.
The claws snatch up you and Nelson. You both struggle
but the grip is steel-strong. “This is all your fault,”
screams Nelson.
You son of a bitch, you think as you get popped into the
monster’s mouth. The teeth come grinding down and the
world goes black.
