You turn away from the beast. You need to keep your
focus.
You point and yell, “Attack the spacemen!”
The punks scream as one and charge at the alien invaders.
The aliens let loose with their rifles. Instead of the black
beams, green beams burst forth and tear into the charging
mass. The beams neatly cut through limbs and torsos -
sending arm, legs, and heads flying through the air.
But too many are charging. The punks attack en mass
and as one. Their invader’s guns may equal instant death but
there are just too many people.
The punks slash with knives and bash with bats. The
aliens’ bodies, not used to Earth’s atmosphere and not at all
agile, fall quickly beneath their attackers.
You charge with your army.
You stab forward with the spikes, tearing spacesuits
and breaking helmets, exposing fragile bodies to the deadly
atmosphere.
You look back and the monster is still coming closer,
tearing through buildings, punks, and spacemen alike.
Your forces break the spacemen’s lines and you all keep
charging forward. Ahead you can see several saucer ships
on the ground. There are some spacemen standing guard but
they are quickly overrun and torn down by the punks.
The ground shakes even harder, nearly throwing you off
your feet. The monster is almost on top of you.
