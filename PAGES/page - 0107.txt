107
You decide to take on the flying saucers. They are the ones
responsible for all this meaningless death and destruction
and you’ve had enough. You’re going to bring the fight to
them.
You and Mr. McWhiskers fly over the city looking for
your target. Beneath you everything is burning and you can
see roving gangs moving through the streets. It is pure chaos.
You quickly come upon one of the saucers hovering in
the air and shooting its death rays at the people and buildings
below. You slam into the hull and break through.
Mr. McWhiskers follows.
You find yourself in a dark hallway. Most of the light is
coming through the hole you created. The walls are made of
some weird pink and spongy material that looks organic, like
a skinned dog. There is half a foot of some unknown clear
liquid covering the floor.
On the wall in front of you there is a poster for the J.J.
Abrams Star Trek movie, crudely taped up. You approach
the poster slowly. You are very confused. Why would aliens
be Star Trek fans?
Never mind that now.
You look to your left and right. There are doors on either
side of you.
You take a coin out of your pocket. You can’t think of
a better way to decide where to go. Heads, left. Tails, right.
Find a coin and flip it.
