“Man you’re crazy, we gotta go!” 
You pull on his shoulder to indicate that he should start running. He looks at the monster once more and then to you. He nods and you both join the crowds .eeing down the street away from the monster. 
The beast follows. You look over your shoulder and see that the monster is quickly gaining on you. It may not be moving fast but it is just so big that it catches up with ease. 
The monster’s next step is so close it shakes the ground beneath you. When it steps forward again, everyone, including you and Solok, get thrown about two feet and come crashing to the ground. 
You land on your back and see the beast’s head plunging forward, straight at you. You scramble to your feet and dash to the side of the road. Its jaws tear the road and claim another dozen victims. 
You spin your head around. Where’s Solok? 
You look up to the beast and see Solok’s corpse sticking half out of the monster’s mouth. 
The thing chews a few times, you have to dodge falling debris, and then it starts to move forward again, ignoring you. 
The redwood-sized back legs stomp down on the street. Far too close for your liking. Nearby cars and rubble bounce from the aftershock. You hide behind a mass of broken concrete, hoping to avoid becoming a smear on the thing’s foot. 
What you don’t see is the thing’s tail crash into you when your back is turned. The tail is bigger and thicker than a train and it carries you straight into a nearby building. The building crumbles from the force of the tail, spilling tons of building material straight down on top of you.
