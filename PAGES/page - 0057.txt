57
You would love to land and get these weak creatures’
blood on your hands, but the ground is still a battlefield and
you didn’t become a great general by taking unnecessary
risks. That’s for the grunts.
You order the navigator to hold a steady course and
direct the weapons operator to open fire. It does not take
long to clear all human life from the area.
You are still in your ship when you are notified that
humanity is extinct. You feel a bit of sadness at hearing
this. You were hoping for a chance to cause much more
devastation.
Oh well, now it’s time for the victory ceremony. You
don’t enjoy the pomp and circumstance but you understand
the need for it all. Ritual and tradition are useful tools for
keeping the troops in line.
The ships land at the victory location. You exit the ship.
Your cheering army surrounds you. They have erected a
massive mountain of skulls, which you climb. The brittle
bones break beneath your feet as you ascend. At the top is a
throne, also made of skulls.
You sit on your ivory perch and stare out at thousands of
joyous warriors who praise your name.
Today is a good day.
