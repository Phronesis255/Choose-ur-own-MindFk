The body slumps down and slides off your hand.
You turn back to Mr. McWhiskers, who raises a paw at

Mr. McWhiskers dashes across the room and hops up
on one of the many control panels. He jumps about hitting
buttons with his paws. You can feel the ship begin to move
and change direction.
“Uhhh...Mr. McWhiskers, where are we going?”
Mr. McWhiskers hits a few more buttons and suddenly
loud punk rock fills the ship.
You flinch at the harsh sounds while Mr. McWhiskers
shuts his eyes in kitty pleasure and head-bangs to the beat.
On the view screen a blur of burning buildings and
wasted terrain flash by as the ship accelerates. Then the
images freezes as the ship comes to a stop. It’s the White
House.
“Oil” mews Mr. McWhiskers as he hits a button. On the
screen a red beam hits the White House and the building
explodes - instantly reduced to burning rubble.
“Right...”
