“Sir, we need an answer.”
You give no indication that you heard the question. The
large overstuffed chair is fit for a commander-in-chief but, in
situations like this, the comfort feels wasted. All the posh is

on you to enjoy.
You spin around in your chair. Your Secretaries of State,
Defense, and Homeland Security stare eagerly at you, awaiting
