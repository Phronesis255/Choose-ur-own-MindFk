120
You may be a cruel God but you do reward those who
live to serve you. If it were not for those that have kept your
memory alive, you would have faded to the dreamland of
dead Gods long ago.
Besides, their treachery against their own species amuses
you.
You come out of the water and tower over your
worshipers, a behemoth come to land. The insects cower
before you.
You roar and their minds shatter. They run off drooling
and jabbering into the vermin nest. They will spread the
news of your glorious return.
You knock over several of the structures around you and
form a crude throne out of the ruins. You sit upon it and the
sky turns a dark scarlet.
You twitch your tentacles and the seas begins the boil
This world is yours.
