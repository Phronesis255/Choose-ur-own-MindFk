You flick your tail angrily as you watch the mammoth
squirrel rampage through the city outside your window. You
lick your paw and rub the side of your head, smoothing the
fur while fuming that you have not been transformed into a
giant.
If anything should be remade into a massive beast of
fear it is you, the divine representation of the feline species.
Instead you are stuck being barely ten inches tall and at the
mercy of those stupid hairless apes.
The sky outside turns a deep shade of purple and you
narrow your eyes, suspicious of this new development.
You turn from the window and fly over to your food dish.
You freeze right as you are about to take your first bite. Since
when could you fly?
You rise into the air and hover, eager to try out your
new powers. You zip through the apartment, knocking over
lamps, books, and anything else not nailed down.
You land in the center of the apartment and feel many
more powers surging through you. You look at the window.
Red beams shoot out of your eyes and shatter the glass.
You fly outside and are high above the city.
You see a bird and rush at it. The bird is not expecting a
cat to attack from above. Ten-inch razor-sharp blades come
out of your paws and shred the bird in seconds. This prey
falls with more ease than you would like.
You hover and look around. Your bloodlust is far from
sated.
You can see the massive squirrel. That would make for
a challenging target. Or what about those flying pie tins you
saw earlier? They could be fun to hunt.
