Night comes and then morning and with the new day the demon returns. It rises majestically and horribly out of the water. It regards the lifeboat with cruel, intelligent eyes and reaches forward, picking up a sailor. The demon lifts the man high in the air and then drops him in its mouth. He chews and you can hear breaking bones and death screams. 
The monster disappears underwater once again. 
The same thing happens the next day. 
And the day after that. 
You are now alone and have been on the boat for three days. You consider killing yourself before the demon comes back but you have nothing and there is nothing on the boat that would work. You could go into the water and take a couple deep breaths but you can’t bring yourself to enter the waves – that’s where the demon is, somewhere. 
It is night but you will not be sleeping. You know what tomorrow will bring and all you can do is wait. 
THE END
