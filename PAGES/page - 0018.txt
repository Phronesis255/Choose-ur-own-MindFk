After several minutes you are finally at the corner of
the building and it sounds like there is a war happening just
around the side. You turn the corner and that is exactly what
you see.
Several dozen soldiers are scattered about, shouting
and shooting at three creatures. One is a forty-foot Cyclops
holding a screaming soldier in its massive clawed hands.
The Cyclops tosses the solider into the air repeatedly like
it is playing a game of catch. The barrage of bullets it’s

Behind it is another thing, this one little more than two

what is affectionately referred to as “the art projects.” It is
amusing itself by stomping on hapless soldiers until they are

where it watches the battle with unnaturally human looking
eyes at the ends of its antennas.
You drop your saw and staple gun. They are not going to

You begin to run to the soldiers, hoping they can provide you
cover and help you. There is a high pitch squealing sound as
one of those bastard flying saucers comes into view over the
trees.
Two beams shoot out and hit the Cyclops and the eyeball
thing. They instantly disappear.
You and all the soldiers still on the field make a mad dash
for the safety of the building. The saucer opens fire and there
