You round a corner and see that the noise came from a comic book store that has just burst into . ames. The building, .lled with paper and cardboard products of all sorts, is a raging inferno with .ames pouring out from the front door and windows. 
Two people stagger out of the building, their bodies completely engulfed. 
Another person emerges from the building but appears to be completely unharmed. Even his clothes appear to be untouched by the scorching heat. He appears to be wearing a Star Trek uniform. You were never a fan of the show, too cheesy for your taste, but you recognize the costume. He’s even wearing pointy ears to match the blue pajamas. 
He lifts his hands above his head and points a hand at each of the burning people. Thick pillars of . ames burst forth from his hands. The two people fall to the ground, . nally dead. 
He turns his head and sees you. Hate .ares up in his eyes. 
Uh oh. 
Try talking to him, turn to page 142. 
Go on the offensive. Attack! Turn to page 26.
