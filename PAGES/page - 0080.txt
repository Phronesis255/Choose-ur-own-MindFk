You fly back into the office, past glowing green typing
drones that do not even look up. Nelson is still flexing his
muscles and his jaw drops once he sees you. You plow into
him, grabbing hold as the two of you smash through the
office’s wall into the hallway.
You roll on the ground holding Nelson close, hitting him
again and again in the face. The blows leave large angry
welts. His teeth fly through the air as you pummel him. You
reach forward with both hands and grab the sides of his head.
Your fingers break through bone and cartilage and you rip
his head apart. You raise the hunks of dripping flesh, bone,
and brain in the air, roaring with victory.
You realize that you are not yelling alone. All the other
employees have come out and are cheering for you. Finally
the cruel oppressor has been overtaken.
They all get to their knees and bow to you and your
strength.
You stand up and stagger back from the corpse, dropping
the hunks of what used to be Nelson’s head. The employees
are still on their knees, looking to you for guidance and
direction.
Your gaze meets their eager eyes and you are not sure
what to say.
You point back at their desks, “Get back to work. Those
TPS Reports are not going to file themselves.”
They scurry back to their workstations and you smile,
pleased by their prompt response.
You walk back into the office and out of habit go over to
your desk. You sit at it but it does not feel right.
You bested Nelson. His office should be yours, a spoil of
war. You head back to his office but pause to tear the head
off of Sanderson. His typing rate has been way lower than it
should be.
You go into Nelson’s office and sit in his plushy chair.
You lean back with your hands behind your head and put
your feet up on his desk.
