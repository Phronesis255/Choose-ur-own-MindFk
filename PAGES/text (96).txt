“What…” 
Solok turns from you and jogs towards the beast. 
“Solok, what are you doing?” He does not respond. 
He runs straight at the monstrosity. 
The thing was still lumbering forward at a slow but extremely destructive pace, each movement toppling over buildings. Its gargantuan paws .attening cars and people with each step. The few who are attempting to engage the beast in battle with their powers are not even slowing it. The behemoth roars and even though you are three blocks away, you can smell the thick stink of .sh. 
Solok is now right in front of it. He stops and looks fearlessly up at the monster. Suddenly there is a huge burst of .ames at his feet and he .ies though the air straight into the thing’s mouth and then he is gone, swallowed whole. 
“What the fuck,” you yell to no one, “that was your great plan?” 
The thing stops moving and goes very still. Its head starts slowly swaying back and forth and a low groan comes from it. The bass is so deep you can feel your bones shaking. 
The monster’s midsection starts to swell out, like someone is in.ating a giant balloon inside the beast. You can hear the skin stretching and internal bones snapping as the midsection grows to larger and larger proportions. It is almost comical when none of the thing’s four legs are even touching the ground anymore. 
Then there is a POP so loud that the noise itself knocks you over. A gigantic ball of .re rise up into the air from where the monster used to be. The monster is now nothing more than a billion tiny bits, .ying through the air in every direction. Parts of it will probably end up miles away. 
Then the blood hits you. You are completely drenched with thick black tar that smells oddly of watermelon. 
You stand, disgusted, and shake the gunk off your hands and wipe the shit off your face. Pieces of the monster are falling all around you but none of them are bigger than your .st.
