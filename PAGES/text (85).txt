You are awoken some time later as you are tossed out of bed and sirens .ll your head. You try to get to your feet but are knocked down again as the ship rocks violently. You brace yourself against the walls and make it out of your room and up to the deck to see what is happening. 
Towering out of the water, hundreds of feet into the sky, is a demon. It has a very human body from the waist up. Large twisted horns protrude from its forehead and its body is covered with red scales. Its arms are raised and it .exes huge muscles at the ship. 
The battleship .res its guns at the thing. As the shells bounce off the thick hide, it laughs deep and long. It winds back a giant .st and punches the side of the ship. As you hear the sound of metal bending and breaking, your heart drops. 
Someone grabs you from behind and pulls you toward the back of the ship. You want to turn and see who and why but you cannot look away from this hellish vision. This is not one of the creations from the island, this is some kind of brand new horror. You are thrown onto a lifeboat that has three other sailors on it. 
“Hold on,” says one of them as he pulls a rope the boat drops twenty feet straight down into the water. 
You manage not to fall out. You watch from the lifeboat as the demon pummels on the battleship until it is smashed to pieces and sinks beneath the water. The demon then disappears underwater after the ship. 
The four of you seem to be in the only lifeboat to escape. You all look and yell for other survivors to no avail. It is then you all realize that there are no supplies and no oars for the boat. You sit wordlessly and wait for help that you know will not come.
