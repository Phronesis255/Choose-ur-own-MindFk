48
You look over your delirious acolytes and give them
your first and final decree, “You are all now free!”
The people cheer and go rushing out of the office place
without even bothering to gather their personal possessions.
You are left alone with Supervisor Nelson’s corpse and
Mr. McWhiskers.
“You know what, Mr. McWhiskers? I think everything is
going to be OK from now on.”
He starts cleaning the blood off his paws.
“Come on,” you start toward the door, “let’s go home.”
Mr. McWhiskers glares but then follows you out. You
two take the elevator down the building’s lobby.
“I’m so proud of us and all that we accomplished today.”
Mr. McWhiskers purrs.
The elevator reaches the lobby and the two of you exit.
You freeze when you see what is happening on the other side
of the lobby’s doors. The entire staff of the office is being
massacred by a group of giant ants. The things are tearing
everyone limb from limb and then feasting on the hunks of
flesh they tear off. People are running and screaming, trying
to get free, but the ants have the workers surrounded and
there is no escape. One person is vainly spraying a can of
bug spray.
You turn to Mr. McWhiskers, “Oh yeah, the giant
monsters.”
Mr. McWhiskers responds with a “Rrooar?”
Before the guard abandoned the front desk he forgot to
turn the television off and a cheesy laugh track fills the lobby.
