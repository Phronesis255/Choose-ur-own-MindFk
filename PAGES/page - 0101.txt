This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. You’ve
always known the shit was going to hit the fan at some point.
You admit that you weren’t expecting intergalactic border-
jumpers, but if that’s the hand God is going to deal, than
that’s how you’ll play.
You are the only human being for a hundred miles
around, your fortress buried deep in the wilderness. The first
two saucers that flew overhead surely weren’t expecting
there to be any human resistance way out here. The surface-
to-air missiles took them out quickly.
You monitor the global situation from your underground
bunker. One by one, all of your global contacts disappeared
as well as all the media outlets. Any saucer that comes
nearby is shot down by your defensive system. The few
giant creatures that come by are quickly cut to shreds by
your patrolling gang of ninja robots.
It soon becomes clear that you are the only person left.
If anyone is going to take care of these alien bastards, it will
have to be you.
You consider what your best course of action should be.
