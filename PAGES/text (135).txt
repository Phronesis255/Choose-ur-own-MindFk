You run like all of Hell is chasing you. In moments you are at the slug. You leap into the air with your arms outstretched to grab hold and climb up. 
Your body hits and your arms sink through the gooey membrane up to your shoulders. Your legs go in up to your knees. 
You are stuck. You try pulling yourself out but the movements just suck you in deeper. You try staying still but you don’t stop sinking, you just go slower. 
Now your whole body has sunk into the creature except for your head. Warm, sticky ooze that smells like a combination of wet dog, mold, and rotten egg runs down the thing’s body and over your face. Then, with an audible POP, your head is sucked in. 
THE END
