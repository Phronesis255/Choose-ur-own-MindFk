You fly off in the direction of your office. You have
always wanted the chance to put Supervisor Nelson in his
place and now, with Mr. McWhiskers as your backup, you
know you can.
Quickly you are back at your former corporate prison. You
and Mr. McWhiskers hover outside the windows, peeking
in. All the workers are still hunched over their keyboards,
typing at an inhuman speed. The green glow from them is
brighter than when you left. You don’t see Nelson anywhere.
The door to his office is closed. He must be behind it.
You slowly open a window, careful to make as little noise
as possible, and climb through. Mr. McWhiskers follows you
inside and quickly scuttles under a nearby desk. None of the
workers notice. They are too super-absorbed in their work.
Surprise is your biggest advantage. Nelson is not going
to see this attack coming.
Then Nelson bursts out of his office and yells, “Why is
my supervisor-sense tingling?” His eyes dart about the room
and then lock on you. He roars like a bull that has been hit in
the balls, and charges you with as much strength.
You brace for the attack and he slams you straight to
the ground. He pounds your face with his fists and the room
starts to go black.
You hear a mew of fury and Mr. McWhiskers bursts out
from under a nearby desk - kitty surprise attack! He flies
between Nelson and you. With one paw of razor-sharp claws
he neatly disembowels Nelson. He hooks a hunk of intestine
with the claws on the other paw.
Mr. McWhiskers flies around Nelson several times,
each go-around pulling out more of your former boss’ guts.
Nelson begins to lose strength as Mr. McWhiskers wraps the
intestines around that asshole’s neck.
Blood dripping in your eyes, you lean up, grab the
intestines and pull tight. Nelson’s face goes blue and he
drops to the ground. Mr. McWhiskers dives for the gaping
wound in his stomach and has a snack.
