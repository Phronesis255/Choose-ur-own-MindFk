You travel ten blocks and gather another hundred soldiers before you encounter another spaceman. At your direction the punks leap upon him and tear him limb from limb. His ray gun useless and his attempts to call for help only adding to your army. 
You push forward, deeper into the city. 
You take notice of a low thumping sound and freeze. You don’t know how long it has been there in the background. When you stop, your army stops. 
You spin around and see no sign of the oncoming creature, but the pounding becomes louder and louder. 
The noise brings more punks out of hiding and they join your ranks. 
You spin around when another sound hits your ears. It sounds like a marching army. You know it’s not yours because they are all standing peacefully and surprisingly quiet for such a large crowd of punks that has raided every commercial supply of alcohol they passed. 
You can see a large group of people walking towards you in an orderly and close formation, a real army. They get closer and you see it is a ground force of spacemen. They are all armed, not with the little ray guns, but with large sliver ri.es that require two hands to hold. 
The pounding becomes thunder and you hear a totally unnatural roar. Approaching from the other direction is a thing at least three hundred feet tall. Its body is covered in thick brown fur and is hunched over like a gorilla. The colossal limbs of the beast end in masses of industrial cable sized pink tentacles. 
Its eight eyes staring at your army with intelligence and hunger from its primate-like face. 
You are trapped and you must .ght. Do you direct your forces at
