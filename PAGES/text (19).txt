You’ve seen enough already to know that Complex 23 is a lost cause. You don’t really give a shit about the experiments or the work you’ve been doing here, not when it means you’re going to die trying to save it. 
Creeping down the hallway, you come to the door for the stairwell. Just down the stairs, down another hall, and then you are outside. You look around. Except for the bodies, there is no one around. 
You push open the door as quietly as possible and step through. You are careful to control the door shutting behind you so as not to make a sound. The concrete stairwell has stairs leading up and down. You see no one and pause, listening intently but hearing nothing. You hold the staple gun raised and ready.You head down the .ight of stairs. There is a door directly in front of you that leads to the .rst .oor and a hallway to the right that leads outside – that’s the direction you want. 
BANG! You spin around as a huge punk violently slams through the door next to you. He has to be at least six feet tall with a completely shaved head but for two spikes of hair jutting out above each ear – one red, one blue. He roars and raises his .sts when he sees you. In one hand is a severed arm that is still bleeding, in the other hand is a bone saw he must have gotten from one of the laboratories. 
He locks murderous eyes with you and charges. 
Try to make it outside before he gets you, turn to page 21. Stand and .ght, turn to page 124.
