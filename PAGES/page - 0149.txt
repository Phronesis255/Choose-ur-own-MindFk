Today had started off as just another day at Complex
23, you went to your station where you performed your daily
monitoring of the “massive battlefield enforces” in Sector 8.
Outside of the Rabbitsaurus dismembering and skull-fucking
the Carrotphant, it was a slow morning.
The giant monsters were contained experiments, but you

You press your ear to the door but hear nothing. You wait
five minutes and still hear nothing. You unlock the door and
slowly open it.
You poke your head out and look up and down the
hallway. The mangled corpses of your former companions
lay strewn about, but the punks have moved on. You step
