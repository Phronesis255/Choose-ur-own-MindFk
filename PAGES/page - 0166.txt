You rise high out of the water. Long sinewy tentacles flick
through the air, tasting this new time. Drowsy eyelids open,
revealing colossal onyx orbs. Your cold and calculating eyes
look to the distance, for there is the infestation. Pests have
taken over your home and it is time to clean them out.
You lumber toward the city, your massive bulk churning
the sea in your wake.
In the bright midday sky, the stars twinkle an ancient
welcoming. The vermin may not be able to see the stars but
you can. After eons of slumber, it is good to know the others
have not forgotten.
The stars are right and you are awake.
When you reach land, a swarm of the insects are
waiting for you. They stand on the rocky shore, their arms
outstretched to your glory.
“Ia! Ia! Cthulhu f’htagn! Ia! la! Cthulhu f’htagn!” they
chant.
At least some on this planet still remember you.
Scoop up the deluded fools and gobble them down, turn to page 63.
Bless them with your power and reward their loyalty, turn to page 120.
