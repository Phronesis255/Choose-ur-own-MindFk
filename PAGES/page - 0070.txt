You see an alleyway to your left and duck down it just
as the giant baby turns in your direction. It wobbles forward
awkwardly. You can hear and feel the pounding of its massive
feet as you run. You just pray that it is not coming for you.
You are about a hundred yards into the alley when the
baby steps into view. You look over your shoulder in horror,
but it hobbles past.
Thank God.
You continue through the alley until you come to the
next street. You peer out but see no signs of any giant things.
You walk down the street with no particular destination
in mind. As you go on, you take notice that not only are there
no monsters on the street to torment you, there is nothing on
the streets. No people anywhere. Just the close sounds of a
happening war.
You go down several blocks and still come upon no sign
of anybody. You are just beginning to get really freaked out
when you see a figure in the distance coming towards you.
“Hello,” you yell and run towards it.
You stop half a block away.
A person in a white full-body spacesuit is walking
towards you, wearing a helmet with a black tinted visor that
prevents you from seeing who is within.
You stare silently, not sure what to do.
The spaceman continues walking, then stops about ten
feet from you. He raises a hand and that’s when you see the
raygun he is holding. You try to dodge out of the way but
you are too late.
The gun emits a black beam that hits you dead-center in
the chest. You expect to feel pain or be hurled to the ground
but nothing happens.
The spaceman cocks his head at you, confused, and fires
again. Yet nothing happens to you.
You hold out your arms and look over your body but see
no sign of injury.
You now feel angry for getting so worried over the beam.
