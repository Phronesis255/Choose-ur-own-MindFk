Be all you can be.
The slogan consumes your mind as you run from the
beast.
Be all you can be.
When all those giant monsters showed up and started
wrecking your country, you were ready and eager. Ain’t no
motherfucking monstrosity going to walk all over your flag.
USA! USA! USA!
Now you are suited up and loaded down with high-
powered weaponry.
Hells yeah! This is what you wanted when you signed
up. No more shooting A-rabs for you. Fuck, they were no
fun. They could barely shoot back.
Giant monsters.. .that’s what you’re talking about. A real
challenge.
The military transport aircraft dropped you off in the
middle the city. You had to rappel down from midair. Badass.
Your squadron walks for two blocks before you
encounter the first beast, a giant rabbit. The thing is bigger
than a McDonald’s.
It takes only fifteen seconds for the creature to hop and
mash all your fellow warriors. So you take the only sensible
course of action - you run.
Be all you can be.
You legs and lungs are burning but you can’t slow
down. The beast is chasing you, hopping along at a leisurely
pace. Unless you want to end up as slimy red paste on the
pavement, you have to keep running.
You run and you run. But it doesn’t matter. A large
shadow falls directly over you. In a split second the creature
will land.
Be all you can be.
