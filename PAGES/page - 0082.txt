82
Your workplace-approved haircut grows out to long
smelly dreadlocks and your clothes morph into a patched-
up mess of black and brown fabrics. You stand up straighter
and prouder. There is so much wrong with the world and you
have all the answers - if only those corporate pigs could put
away their greed and listen to you.
You walk down the street and soon run into other
people. You try to organize a march against our capitalist,
racist, hetero-normative oppressors. You explain to them
the emergency of our current situation, quoting Marx and
Kropotkin, but the uneducated troglodytes do not understand
the importance of what you are saying.
You flip them off and continue on your way.
Maybe the rest of the world will rise to your intellectual
level at some point, until then you have your commune and
benefit shows for causes that accomplish nothing.
One day the world will realize you were right all along.
Until then, fuck ‘em.
THE END
