more like a severe burn victim than an alien. 
Its blank white eyes stare at you as the thing gasps for air. The horrible sound it makes reminds you of the time you were .ve and your cousin had an asthma attack in front of you. 
A respirator rises up from the front of the suit and covers its mouth and nose. You can hear its breathing stabilize. 
A straw-like tube juts out from the respirator and begins to make buzzing sounds. You can see tiny blades twirling around at its end. 
The tube extends out and moves towards your forehead. 
You shout and shake your head and body, trying to break free. More hands reach out and grab you. Three grab your head, holding you still. 
You scream as the tube drills into your skull. Blood, skin, and bone bits .y through the air in front of your eyes. Your whole skull vibrates and your eyeballs vibrate in their sockets, making the whole world bounce. It breaks through your skull and your vision is still again. The world goes bright white and your limbs convulse. 
The tube stops and you hear a sound like a vacuum. Your head feels lighter and lighter as the white light turns to fuzz. 
THE END
