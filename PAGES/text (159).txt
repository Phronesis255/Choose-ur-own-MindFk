You open your eyes and you are soaring high in the air surrounded by clouds. You look at your body and see insect legs. Your wings are huge and multi-colored. You notice that your entire body is covered with .ne fuzz. Then it dawns on you. 
I’m a giant fucking moth!?! 
You .ap your wings and keep .ying. How can you use being a giant moth to your advantage? How can you save humankind? 
You think of nothing. 
You’re .ying and pondering your problem when sweet singing creeps into your mind . Beneath you is wide open ocean. In the distance is a large rocky island. You are heading there. You don’t know why, but you know you must. As you get closer, the singing gets louder. 
You arrive at the island and there is a precipice with two very tiny women standing on the edge, they are much smaller than normal humans. They are the ones singing and despite their size they were able to call to you from so far away. 
Your gargantuan body dwarfs them as you land. They sing louder and hold up their arms to your glory. You feel happy, at peace, drugged. 
Your head darts forward and your mouth gobbles the tiny women. Your jaws quickly crush them to mush and you swallow. As your body begins to absorb them, you fall into a deep sleep. You feel better than you ever have in your life. You sleep and never think of your mission again. 
THE END
