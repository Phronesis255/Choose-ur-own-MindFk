You charge at the punks, slashing and stabbing with
your spikes. They quickly fall beneath your savage attack.
Limbs and heads fly about you and, within moments, you are
covered with hot sticky blood.

down as well. You hack and slash until none are left. You
stand in the center of a massive, gooey mound of limbs and
organs. You have never felt more alive in your life.
You climb down from the viscera pile and catch your
breath. Your heart pounds and your veins feel like they are
pumping molten lead. You hear an explosion and yelling
from somewhere close by. You pull two fresh spikes from
your head and go off in the direction of the cry, hoping and
hunting for more spacemen.
