Everyone laughed at you when you started building the
ship. No one believed that you received the directions from
the spirit of William Shatner. You know he’s not dead but
that made the apparition even weirder and more worthy of
your attention. He gave you very detailed directions very

A hint of metal shines on the thing’s back - there’s your
target. Discretely poking out from between the beast’s scales,
you see a zipper slider.
Your ship darts forward and the mechanical fingers
