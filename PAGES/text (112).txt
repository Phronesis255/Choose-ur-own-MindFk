You open your eyes and .nd yourself standing in the center of a city looking down at the tops of buildings. You examine your body and .nd you’re covered in green scales. You have two massive legs and two stubby arms. You feel large spines running down your back and your tail waving with your girth. Your tail crashes into a building and you shake your whole body. 
An animal scream causes you to spin around. You see a huge gorilla, just as large as you, charging. It runs on all fours, its feet and hands tossing people and cars aside and smashing into surrounding buildings. 
It stops about two blocks from you and stands up straight. The beast throws back its head and unleashes a primal war cry. It beats its chest, adding a drum rhythm. 
You open your mouth. A bright blue beam shoots out and hits the ape in the face. The monster’s head explodes, spraying blood, bone, and brains into the air. The corpse sways for a moment and then collapses to the ground, taking down two buildings with it. 
You roar victoriously. 
You notice a loud thumping sound coming closer. You turn and look around and see a small .eet of helicopters approaching. You try speaking to them, to tell them that you are on their side, but only beastly growls come out. 
The helicopters are getting closer and they look ready for a .ght. 
Try .nding another way to signal them, turn to page 151. It’s you or them. Kill them, turn to page 42.
