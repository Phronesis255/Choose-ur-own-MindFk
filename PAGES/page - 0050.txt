50
You sprout thick black rimmed glasses. Your hair turns
into a stylish black-dyed asymmetrical do. Your black dress
pants turn khaki and your button up dress shirt grows an
argyle sweater vest over top.
You are overcome with the sadness of this world and
your fate. You crumble to the ground crying.
The spaceman cocks his head at you, then becomes
disinterested and moves on.
Why, oh why, are you cursed with this feeble existence?
You know you could be so much more. If only your family
was more supportive... if only you had a girlfriend... things
could be so much better.
The sorrow of it all is crippling. You kick a trashcan and
twist your ankle.
It will be OK, you know. You will go home and listen
to Saves the Day and you will be connected to others who
comprehend this kind of loneliness.
Then you get stepped on by a giant walking carrot.
Serves you right you piece of shit.
THE END
