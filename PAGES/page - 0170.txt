170
You...you...you...
I sit back from my laptop and rub my forehead. I grab the
PBR can next to me and take a swig.
I’m getting tired of thinking of all these ridiculous
endings. This seemed like a fun project in the beginning, but
now it has become an endurance run of absurdist violence.
I give up.
Fuck it. It’s four a.m. and I’m tired as shit.
There’s a really stupid picture on the opposite page and
some blank lines. Write your own damn ending.
This one’s really up to you.
I’m getting another drink.
THE END
