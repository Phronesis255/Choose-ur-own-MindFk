You never thought it would come to this, you see no choice but to use the secret super weapon. You walk the half mile from your shack to the secret clearing. You stand on a hill overlooking the large football-.eld-size area of grass. You pull the remote control from the secret pocket of your hunting vest. 
You push the button on the controller and the grass plane .ips open to expose two giant metal doors. White steam billows out from the revealed chasm and a metal platform rises up and locks into place. 
In the center of the platform are a steel box and an altar with a dagger and an old book on it. 
That accursed book. 
You pick up the dagger and open the book. You begin to read the spell. You hoped this day would never come, but you would rather give this planet to its original owners than these invading alien scumbags. 
Directly above you a vortex breaks open in the air. It looks like a mini black hole. It spins around and you can hear unearthly chanting from somewhere deep inside it. 
You .ip open the lid of the metal box and freeze in horror. The baby is dead. You reach inside and pull the corpse out. Gripping it .rmly by one foot, you hold it out in front of you. The body is blue and bloated. It has been dead for some time. You see the food and water you left is untouched. The damn bastard just up and died. 
You toss the body aside. The ground shakes from the monster’s roar as it gets closer. 
You need a sacri.ce for the spell to work. You look around in desperation but there is nothing useable. You grip the dagger tighter. Once the spell has been started, you can’t stop. You can only see one option and you don’t like it. 
You speak the next lines from the book and raise both your hands into the air; one is holding the dagger, the other is open with . ngers outstretched. 
In one quick motion you drag the blade across your wrist.
