You do not need to go back and . nish the . ght. You have escaped from that corporate hell and with this new power there is so much more that you can do. The big picture has suddenly gotten a lot bigger. 
You .y over to your apartment to save Mr. McWhiskers because if you do not, who will? 
Rather than entering the front door to the building, you smash through the window. 
Your apartment is in total disarray. Mr. McWhiskers .ies in circles around you, mewing with joy, his long gray fur matted tightly against his small body. Whatever has changed you has also changed your cat. 
He .ies up to you and rubs his face against yours, purring. You hold him tight, the two of you happy to reunite in the wake of all this strangeness. 
The building rocks as a monster moves somewhere close by. You can’t stay here. This place is not safe. You cradle Mr. McWhiskers under your arm and .y out the window. 
As you soar through the sky, Mr. McWhiskers wiggles his way out of your grip and takes .ight next to you. 
With this new power there is now a whole new world open to Mr. McWhiskers and you. 
Go back to your of.ce to liberate the other workers, turn to page 95. Go after the monsters that are destroying your city, turn to page 139. Go after the .ying saucers that are responsible for all this horror, turn to page 107.
