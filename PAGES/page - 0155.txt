155
the air out of you. You lay crumpled and gasping for breath
when another punk grabs you by your Mohawk and drags
you over to a nearby building.
He slams your head into the bricks. The first hit breaks
your nose and blood splatters across your face. The second
bash makes the whole world go fuzzy.
You feel a sharp pain in your back again and again - you
think someone is stabbing you but you are too weak to turn
and look.
Thankfully, the world quickly fades to red and then black.
THE END
