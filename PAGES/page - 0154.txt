you can see a dark wet spot where contact was made. The
punk pounds down again and again while the man weakly
tries to deflect the metal bludgeon. The man goes still but
the punk doesn’t stop his attack. He only ceases when his
victim’s head is reduced to slimy pulp.
Once the punks are finished with their victims, they take

yourself at your attacker.
Another punk runs up from your left side and slams into
you. You two tumble to the ground. He is faster and gets
up to his feet first. He kicks you in the stomach, knocking
