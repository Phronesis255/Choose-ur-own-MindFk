You pull out spikes from your head and charge at this Trekkie .rebug. He points his hands at you and great long bursts of .re shoot out. But you’re too fast and you dodge the attack, the .ames narrowly missing. You feel the heat on the back of your neck. 
You leap at him, stabbing forward with your spikes. With a loud CRACK both weapons snap in half when they make contact with his chest. His uniform doesn’t even tear. You both freeze for a moment, surprised. 
He acts .rst, raising both of his hands he puts them right in your face, giving your head a double-dose of full on .re. Your vision is .lled with dancing .ames but it doesn’t even hurt, just feels pleasantly warm. 
The .ames stop and you can see his cocked head regarding you. “I do not believe it is logical for us to continue this battle.” 
You nod, agreeing. 
“Solok.” He holds out his hand. 
You take it and introduce yourself, “Si.” 
He breaks the handshake and points past you. “I believe he is someone it is logical to attack.” 
You turn around and see a lone spaceman walking towards you from across the street. 
You grin and pull two fresh weapons from your head. “I got ‘em.” 
You charge and the spaceman raises the ray gun at you and .res. You easily duck the black beam and jam both spikes into his gut. They sink in up to your hands and thick green goo oozes out from the wounds. The spaceman convulses. You pull out the blades and the corpse collapses straight to the ground. 
“Piece of cake,” you say while turning around. 
Solok is curled up on the ground where you left him. The spaceman’s raygun must have hit him when you ducked. 
You rush over to him and kneel down. “Solok, are you OK?”
