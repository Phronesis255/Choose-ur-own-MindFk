You walk down the hall clutching the staple gun, but you
know with the experiments on the loose, the weapon will be
no help.
Hall after hall you journey through until, finally, you
make it to the one that leads to the control room. You look
down at the door, almost unwilling to believe you actually
made it this far.
The door to the control room opens and one of those
spacemen walks out. It raises its raygun and fires at you.
You duck to the left and narrowly avoid the black beam. The
spaceman takes a few steps forward, aims, and fires again.
Once again you manage to dodge the blast. This lucky streak
can’t keep up.
The spaceman is now ten feet from you. He raises the
gun. You know he will not miss this time and you do not
have the strength to attack and overpower him.
A door slides open in the wall next to the spaceman where
there should not be one. The spaceman does not notice the
hand with the gun reaching out from the passageway. The
weapon is level with the visor on the spaceman’s helmet.
The gun fires and the visor shatters away.
The creature within the helmet has a vaguely human
face but looks like a severe burn victim. The thing opens
its mouth but no sound comes out. Its eyes are bulging out
of their sockets and then with a POP, the spaceman’s head
explodes, splattering thick, creamy green goo across the
walls and floor.
The holder of the gun steps from the secret doorway.
It’s Alfred P. Farnsworth, the super-secret scientist who was
supposedly in charge of the whole facility. No one you know
has ever actually met him. Many even speculated that he
was not even real, the he was a figment of the government’s
overactive imagination.
His wall-sized portrait decorates the cafeteria, so you
recognize his round squat body, pig nose, crew cut, and
coke-bottle glasses.
