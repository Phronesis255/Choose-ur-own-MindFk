Nurse, please apply piercings.”
The woman grabs your mouth and purses your lips. She
drives a pen through your lips and leaves it. Binding your
mouth and spraying your face with a red mist. She pushes
another through and another. When she is done there are five
pens through your lips. It hurts too bad to even try screaming.
The man goes back to work. He digs his fingers into
the cuts and grips the flaps of flesh just above your ears. He
pulls back hard, tearing your scalp away from your head. He
continues until the skin is only attached to your head by a
strip down the center.
“Stapler,” he says.
The woman hands him a plain office stapler. He uses it to
attach both the opposite sides of your scalp together.
He stands back and smiles, admiring your wonderful
new Mohawk.
