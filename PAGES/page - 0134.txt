“Into the saucers!”
The punks swarm up the boarding platforms and into the
spaceships.
You lead one group into the closest saucer. Two spacemen
rush you with rifles raised but you are too quick and stab
them both in the throat with your spikes. Punks rush past
you, swarming into the ship and seeking out spacemen to
massacre.
In moments, your forces have taken complete control of
the ship. You sit on the bridge of the spacecraft and punks
are at all the controls around you. You have no idea what
any of the strange buttons do. The punks however, seem
to understand it all. In addition to improving their sense
of fashion and taste in music, the ray guns also seemed to
have installed the knowledge of how to fly intergalactic
spaceships.
On the wall-encompassing view screen you can see the
other commandeered spaceships taking formation behind you.
“Incoming enemy,” says a pierced man with a tom and
sleeveless Liberty shirt behind you.
The screen shifts to an image of several saucers flying at
your squadron.
“Attack,” you say with confidence.
Beams shoot out of your saucers and they cut down the
enemy in no time at all. You smile at the smoldering image
on the view screen.
Suddenly, the ship rocks about, almost throwing you
from your chair.
“What was that?” you yell.
A voice answers from behind you, “Something, one of
the monsters, has latched onto the ship.”
There is a terrible screech of tearing metal and then the
ceiling above you splits open. A giant beak tears through and
snatches up one of the punks.
You can feel the ship shifting course and speeding for
the ground.
