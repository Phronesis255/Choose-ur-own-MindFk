You decide to get on the smaller ship. It looks faster than
anything else around and a speedy escape is what you really
value right now. It doesn’t take long for the ship to get loaded
up and ready to go.
The boat pulls away from the dock before most of the
other ships. As you gain speed, the water starts to churn
violently. Suddenly huge tentacles, as thick as tree trunks,
shoot out of the water and begin tearing apart ships and
scooping up people.
Your boat reaches full speed and shoots out of the dock.
As you escape, you can see the large battleship becoming
wrapped up by dozens of tentacles. There is the loud
screaming of tearing metal and then the battleship breaks in
two. It is a good thing you didn’t choose to go there.
Your boat races away from the dock. You sit on the deck,
lay back and quickly fall asleep.
