You stand up and throw the stack of TPS Reports
into the air and wave your arms about. And scream,
“BWWWHHHAAA AHHHH PPPFFFTTTTH!”

He’s a large man, at least two feet taller than you and
twice as broad.
You sink back into your chair and look out the window.
The creature is now dancing a jig, playfully tossing its
claws over its head and jumping back and forth. Each move
toppling buildings and surely destroying thousands of lives.
Nelson is now towering over you. You shrink smaller
into your chair.
“Now what the fuck is the problem,” Nelson screams in
your face. He had tuna fish for lunch.
You turn and point to the creature, which is now humping
the courthouse.

law and order. It faces you and rises one claw. It looks like it
is waving at you.
Not sure what exactly to do, you wave back.
You sit back in your chair and consider the situation.
