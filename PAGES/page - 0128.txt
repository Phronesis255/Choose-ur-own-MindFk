You sit down at the computer and within minutes
hack into the mainframe and have access to literally every
computer system in the building. At your command, all the
automatic locks seal on every door and main power and
communication are restored.
There is so much to do. You need to find out how many
people are still alive in the building, how to permanently

On the third blow, a large chunk of skull cracks off and
falls to the desk. You look in the mirror and see the pink of
