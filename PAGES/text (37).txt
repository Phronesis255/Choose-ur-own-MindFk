You take one of the red vials from the cabinet. You hold it up to your eyes to inspect it. The liquid is cloudy and swirling, like thick beer. 
You drink it all in one gulp. It tastes like those .reball candies. 
You don’t feel anything right away and wonder how long it will be before it takes effect. 
You suddenly realize that you are pacing back and forth. You stop yourself and try to calm down. You tell yourself there is nothing to be nervous about. 
You then feel intense heat inside yourself. It feels like the very air around you is beginning to boil. You begin to claw at your clothes. You need to get them off. It is just too hot. 
The air gets hotter and hotter and you collapse to the ground, gasping to breathe through the suffocating heat. 
And then, with a POP, your body explodes. The room is neatly coated with .ne layers of gore and, where you fell to the ground, there is a smoldering, human-shaped black burn. 
What an interesting weapon for chemical warfare. Imagine the possibilities of turning your enemies into unwitting suicide bombs. Too bad this didn’t help you. 
THE END
