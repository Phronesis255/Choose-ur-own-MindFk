“FFFRREEEEEEEEEDDDDDOOOOMMMM!!!!!!” you scream. 
Your coworkers roar with approval. 
You charge forward, past Nelson, and to the exit door. Nelson just watches in stunned silence as you rush by with your mob in close pursuit. 
You lead them down all .fty .oors of the stairwell, everyone screaming “Freedom!” in unison the whole way. 
The fresh air hits you hard. You can’t remember feeling anything so glorious. You stop and raise your .sts in victory. Your dedicated followers scream and jump with joy around you. 
Then a giant .ying squid lands on you, squishing you and your cohorts .at. 
THE END
