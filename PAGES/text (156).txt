You turn back to Mr. McWhiskers, who raises a paw at you and says, “Oi!” 
“Right…” 
Mr. McWhiskers dashes across the room and hops up on one of the many control panels. He jumps about hitting buttons with his paws. You can feel the ship begin to move and change direction. 
“Uhhh…Mr. McWhiskers, where are we going?” 
“Oi!” 
“Yeah…” 
Mr. McWhiskers hits a few more buttons and suddenly loud punk rock .lls the ship. 
You .inch at the harsh sounds while Mr. McWhiskers shuts his eyes in kitty pleasure and head-bangs to the beat. 
On the view screen a blur of burning buildings and wasted terrain .ash by as the ship accelerates. Then the images freezes as the ship comes to a stop. It’s the White House. 
“Oi!” mews Mr. McWhiskers as he hits a button. On the screen a red beam hits the White House and the building explodes – instantly reduced to burning rubble.
