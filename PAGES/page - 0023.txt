You have always had a fondness for squirrel flesh so how
could you resist this walking buffet. You fly down and buzz
around the transformed animal’s head, mewing with fury.
The beast swats at you but you are too fast to be hit.
You attack the squirrel’s throat, biting and slashing. You
are quickly and gloriously bathed with blood. You wiggle
and dig into the fur and flesh. Soon you are completely inside
the thing’s neck and you can feel its body convulsing. You
keep tearing and soon pop out the other side.
“Mmmmeeeeeewwwwwwwwwww!!!!!” You roar vic-
toriously into the air while the massive corpse collapses
beneath you. You fly back to the body and feast upon its
flesh.
Once you have had your fill, you curl up in one of its eye
sockets (now minus an eye, thanks to your desecration) and
quickly fall asleep.
You flick your tail as you dream of what you will do to
the hairless apes with these new powers.
You are no longer Mr. McWhiskers, you are now Mr.
McWhiskers - the Super-Cat!
