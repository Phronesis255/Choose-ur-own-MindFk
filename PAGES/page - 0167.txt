You’ve never been very comfortable with guns or
monsters, so you choose the door with the beaker.
You enter the room and find yourself in a very traditional
laboratory. Large white counters fill the room. All available
surfaces are cluttered with papers, computers, test tubes,
beakers and cages with various rodents.
All the computers are down so you race about, picking
up and reading various notes that are out in the open to find
out what people were working on in this room. What you
read is some pretty high level genetic research, most beyond
what you can understand, but you can gather that people were
working on developing chemical cocktails that dramatically
alter human body chemistry if consumed.
You turn around and look at the far wall. There are two
glass cases. Each one filled with dozens of small glass vials.
In one case, the vials are filled with a red liquid, in the other
the vials glisten with blue.
You walk over to the case and read the labels on the
bottle. You understand that these are the finished products of
what the papers were talking about. There is writing on the
vials that you don’t understand.
You came here looking for a weapon and it looks like
you found it. You just don’t know what it does.
Which color vial do you want to drink?
Red, turn to page 46.
