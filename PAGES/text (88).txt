You sigh and pick up the next TPS Report. You need to get through these. The company doesn’t pay you twenty-.ve cents over minimum wage for nothing. 
You load up the database on your computer and start transferring the information. Everything is going . ne until you come across a number that you can’t make out. It is either a six or a .ve but you cannot tell from the handwriting. You check the name on the bottom to see who .lled out the form. It was Margaret. She has terrible handwriting and you can never be sure what she is trying to communicate. 
Unfortunately, Margaret is out sick today. You can’t ask her what it says. You don’t like leaving a form uncompleted so you decide to guess. 
Assume that it is a six, turn to page 20. Assume that it is a .ve, turn to page 161.
